IMPORTANT TODOS
===============

1.	At the moment the site forces you to either nominate yourself or vote for
	someone who has already nominated themselves, this causes the following
	problems.

	a)	To nominate yourself you also HAVE to vote as well...

	b)	The first several people to login basically have to either nominate
		themselves or vote for the handful of other people who also nominated
		themselves.

	c)	The first person to login during nomination period has to nominate
		themselves for EVERYTHING.

	SOLUTION: The best solution would be to have a nomination period where users
			  can login and nominate themselves (no actual voting). Then during
			  the actual nomination voting period have the positions they already
			  nominated themselves for grayed out.

			  -> During the nomination period enable having some entries blank
				 so you can submit just nominating yourself for 1 position.


2.	Need to add support to prevent someone who is an incumbent from nominating
	themselves, this avoids situations where you have someone running against
	themselves!

5.	Have to MANUALLY make the table this year for the incumbents, call in
	winners_elect_2011 and put in the 4 positions from this year.

	->	These users should also be in members_2012 as well, they would have been
		added if they logged into the site.
