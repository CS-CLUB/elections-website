	<h1>Nomination Period Closed</h1>
	<br/>
  <p> Thank you for visiting the Computer Science Club election website, the nomination period
  		is <strong>currently closed</strong>. The final election period for the executive positions 
  		takes place on the first day after <strong>September 14</strong> that lands on a weekday. The 
  		election period on that day is open for a full 24-hours from <strong>12:00am - 11:59pm</strong>.
  		So unlike the nomination period it is important that you remember to vote on the day of the final election.

  		the Computer Science Club for at least one semester. If you would like to find out more about
