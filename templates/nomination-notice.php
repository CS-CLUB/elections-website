  <p>
  		If you would like to run in the election you must <strong>first nominate yourself</strong>
  		for the position(s) that you would like to run for as others will not be able to vote for you
  		unless you first nominate yourself. To nominate yourself simply leave the default option 
  		(which is you) for each of the position you would like to run for.
  </p>
  <p>
  		Another thing to remember, <strong>nominating yourself does not use up your vote</strong>, 
  		so feel free to nominate yourself and then vote for whomever you please.
